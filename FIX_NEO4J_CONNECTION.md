# Fix for Neo4j Connection Error at Startup

## Problem
When running `python run_web_app.py`, you get:
```
ValueError: Could not connect to Neo4j database. Please ensure that the url is correct
```

This happens because `neo4j_env.py` tries to connect to Neo4j **at import time**, and if Neo4j isn't running, the entire application fails to start.

## Solution

I've updated `neo4j_env.py` to handle connection failures gracefully. However, you still need to ensure Neo4j is running before using the application.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Start Neo4j First (Recommended)

1. **Start Neo4j:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (if installed as service)
   neo4j start
   
   # Or check if it's already running
   neo4j status
   ```

2. **Verify Neo4j is accessible:**
   - Open browser: http://localhost:7474
   - Login with your credentials

3. **Then start the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python run_web_app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Updated Code

The updated `neo4j_env.py` now:
- ‚úÖ Handles connection failures gracefully at import time
- ‚úÖ Prints a warning instead of crashing
- ‚úÖ Allows the Flask app to start
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But Neo4j must be running before you click "Initialize RAG Systems"

## What Changed

1. **neo4j_env.py** - Now uses try/except to handle connection failures
2. Connection is attempted at import but won't crash if it fails
3. You'll see a warning message instead

## Expected Behavior Now

**If Neo4j is NOT running:**
```
Warning: Neo4j connection failed at import time: ...
Please ensure Neo4j is running before using the application.
============================================================
  PEERS RAG Flask Web Application
============================================================

Starting server...
Access at: http://localhost:5000
```

The server will start, but when you click "Initialize RAG Systems" or submit a query, you'll get an error saying Neo4j is not connected.

**If Neo4j IS running:**
Everything works normally.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Without Neo4j running:**
   ```bash
   python run_web_app.py
   ```
   Should see warning but server starts.

2. **Start Neo4j, then refresh the page and test:**
   - Click "Test Connections" - should work
   - Click "Initialize RAG Systems" - should work
   - Submit a query - should work

## Alternative: Check Neo4j Status

Before starting the server, always verify Neo4j:

```bash
# Check if Neo4j is running
neo4j status

# If not running, start it
neo4j start

# Wait a few seconds for it to fully start, then:
python run_web_app.py
```

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **Server can start** even if Neo4j is down
- ‚úÖ **Better error messages** instead of crashes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neo4j must be running** to use the application
- üí° **Best practice**: Always start Neo4j before the Flask app
