# PEERS RAG Pipeline Status

## üöÄ Pipeline Running

The complete PEERS RAG pipeline is now executing in the background. This process will:

1. **Parse CSV** - Extract company data (~7,591 companies)
2. **Create Neo4j Graph** - Build knowledge graph with nodes and relationships
3. **Generate Text Chunks** - Create searchable descriptions for each company
4. **Generate Embeddings** - Create vector embeddings using OpenAI API

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Runtime

- **Parsing**: ~30 seconds ‚úÖ (Completed)
- **Graph Creation**: ~5-10 minutes (In Progress)
- **Chunking**: ~2-3 minutes (Pending)
- **Embeddings**: ~30-60 minutes (Pending - depends on API rate limits)

**Total Estimated Time**: 40-75 minutes

## üìä What's Being Created

### Nodes
- **Company**: ~7,591 companies with market data, performance metrics
- **Country**: 62 countries
- **Region**: 7 regions  
- **Sector**: 11 sectors
- **Industry**: 174 industries
- **Exchange**: ~72 exchanges
- **Company_Chunk**: Text chunks for semantic search

### Relationships
- `Company` -[:IN_COUNTRY]-> `Country`
- `Company` -[:IN_REGION]-> `Region`
- `Company` -[:IN_SECTOR]-> `Sector`
- `Company` -[:IN_INDUSTRY]-> `Industry`
- `Company` -[:LISTED_ON]-> `Exchange`
- `Company` -[:HAS_Chunk_INFO]-> `Company_Chunk`

## üîç Monitor Progress

You can monitor the pipeline in several ways:

### 1. Check Neo4j Browser
Open: http://localhost:7474

Run this query to see node counts:
```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n) as Label, count(n) as Count
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

### 2. Check Terminal Output
The pipeline prints progress messages like:
```
Progress: 100/7591 companies processed
[OK] Created 62 Country nodes
[OK] Created 7 Region nodes
...
```

### 3. Watch for Completion
Look for this final message:
```
================================================================================
  PIPELINE COMPLETE
================================================================================
```

## ‚úÖ After Completion

Once the pipeline completes, you can:

### Test GraphRAG Queries
```bash
python PEERS_RAG_main.py
```

Or in Python:
```python
from PEERS_RAG_graphRAG import PEERSGraphRAG

rag = PEERSGraphRAG()
result = rag.query("Which technology companies are in the US?")
print(result)
```

### Test VectorRAG Queries
```python
from PEERS_RAG_vectorRAG import PEERSVectorRAG

rag = PEERSVectorRAG()
result = rag.query("Find large healthcare companies")
print(result)
```

## üìù Example Queries

### GraphRAG Examples
- "Which companies are in the Technology sector?"
- "Show me companies listed on NASDAQ"
- "Find pharmaceutical companies in Asia"
- "List companies with positive one week change"
- "Which US companies are in Healthcare?"

### VectorRAG Examples
- "Tell me about large Fortune 500 companies"
- "Find companies similar to Apple"
- "Show me technology startups"
- "What are the top financial services companies?"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Pipeline Stops
Check Neo4j connection:
```bash
# Verify Neo4j is running
neo4j status
```

### If API Limit Errors
OpenAI has rate limits. The pipeline will retry, but you may need to wait.

### If Memory Issues
Edit the batch sizes in `PEERS_RAG_pipeline.py`:
```python
pipeline.ingestion.create_company_graph(parser, batch_size=50)  # Reduce from 100
pipeline.chunking.create_company_chunks(parser, batch_size=50)
pipeline.embedding_gen.generate_embeddings_for_all_chunks(batch_size=25)
```

## üìä Expected Final Stats

After completion, you should see:
- ~7,591 Company nodes
- ~62 Country nodes
- ~7 Region nodes
- ~11 Sector nodes
- ~174 Industry nodes
- ~72 Exchange nodes
- ~15,000-20,000 Company_Chunk nodes (with embeddings)
- ~75,000-100,000 relationships total

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Wait for pipeline completion
2. Test queries with `python PEERS_RAG_main.py`
3. Explore the graph in Neo4j Browser
4. Customize prompts for your specific use case
5. Add parameter library support (parameter_library_sync.csv)
