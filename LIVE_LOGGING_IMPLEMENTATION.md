# Live Logging System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a real-time logging system that displays backend processing steps in the UI using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This allows users to see exactly what happens when they submit queries and identify where failures occur.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`PEERS_RAG_flask_app.py`)

#### Log Manager Class
- **Location**: Lines 22-51
- Thread-safe log manager that collects and broadcasts log entries
- Supports multiple concurrent log subscribers
- Logs include timestamp, type (info/success/error), and message

#### Server-Sent Events Endpoint
- **Route**: `/api/logs/stream` (Line 69)
- Implements SSE protocol for streaming logs to frontend
- Maintains persistent connection with automatic heartbeat
- Handles client connection/disconnection gracefully

#### Enhanced Query Endpoint
- **Route**: `/api/query` (Line 113)
- Now includes detailed logging at every step:
  - Query reception
  - RAG system initialization
  - Query execution (GraphRAG or VectorRAG)
  - Success/failure with timing information
  - Error handling with detailed messages

### 2. Frontend Changes (`templates/peers_rag_index.html`)

#### UI Components
- **Logs Container**: Dark-themed terminal-style display (Lines 392-398)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for log types with color coding:
  - Info: Blue (#60a5fa)
  - Success: Green (#34d399)
  - Error: Red (#f87171)
  - Connection: Purple (#a78bfa)

#### JavaScript Functions
- **connectLogStream()**: Establishes SSE connection to backend
- **addLogEntry()**: Adds log entries to UI with animations
- **clearLogs()**: Clears the log display
- Auto-scroll to latest logs
- Maintains last 100 log entries

### 3. Log Flow When User Submits Query

```
1. User clicks "Submit Query"
   ↓
2. Frontend: showAlert('Processing query...')
   ↓
3. Frontend: POST /api/query with {query, mode}
   ↓
4. Backend: Log: 'Received query: "[query]" in [mode] mode'
   ↓
5. Backend: Log: 'Initializing RAG systems...'
   ↓
6. Backend: Log: 'RAG systems ready'
   ↓
7. Backend: Log: 'Executing [mode] query...'
   ↓
8a. If GraphRAG:
   - Log: 'Generating Cypher query from natural language...'
   - Execute Cypher generation
   - Log: 'Cypher query generated successfully'
   OR
   - Log: 'Failed to generate Cypher query: [error]'
   
8b. If VectorRAG:
   - Log: 'Performing semantic search in vector store...'
   - Execute vector search
   - Log: 'Semantic search completed successfully'
   OR
   - Log: 'Failed to perform semantic search: [error]'
   ↓
9. Backend: Log: 'Query completed in X.XXs'
   ↓
10. Backend: Log: 'Retrieved [N] characters of results'
   ↓
11. Backend: Return JSON response
   ↓
12. Frontend: Display results and update history
```

### 4. Error Handling

All steps include try-catch blocks that:
- Log error messages with full stack traces
- Display errors in red in the log viewer
- Maintain system stability
- Provide debugging information

### 5. How to Use

1. **Start the Flask app**:
   ```bash
   python PEERS_RAG_flask_app.py
   ```

2. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Initialize RAG** (optional, logs will show this):
   - Click "Initialize RAG Systems" button

4. **Submit a query**:
   - Enter query in input box
   - Select mode (GraphRAG or VectorRAG)
   - Click "Submit Query"

5. **Watch logs in real-time**:
   - Logs appear in the "Live System Logs" section
   - Each step is logged as it happens
   - Errors are highlighted in red
   - Timestamps show when each event occurred

### 6. Log Viewing Features

- **Color-coded log types**: Info (blue), Success (green), Error (red)
- **Timestamps**: Every log entry shows exact time
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to latest log
- **Animation**: New logs slide in smoothly
- **Clear button**: Remove all logs to start fresh
- **Limit**: Maintains only last 100 entries

### 7. Debugging Guide

When a query fails, check the logs to see:
1. Which step was executing when it failed
2. Exact error message
3. Time when failure occurred
4. Query parameters that were sent

Example log output:
```
[14:32:15] [INFO] Received query: "Which companies are in Technology?" in GraphRAG mode
[14:32:15] [INFO] Initializing RAG systems...
[14:32:16] [SUCCESS] RAG systems ready
[14:32:16] [INFO] Executing GraphRAG query...
[14:32:16] [INFO] Generating Cypher query from natural language...
[14:32:17] [INFO] Cypher query generated successfully
[14:32:17] [SUCCESS] Query completed in 1.23s
[14:32:17] [INFO] Retrieved 450 characters of results
```

### 8. Technical Details

#### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Uses one-way communication from server to client
- Maintains persistent HTTP connection
- Automatically reconnects on connection loss
- Low overhead for real-time updates

#### Thread Safety
- LogManager uses threading.Lock() to ensure thread-safe operations
- Supports multiple concurrent clients
- Queue-based event distribution

#### Performance
- Minimal overhead on query execution
- Logs are buffered and sent asynchronously
- Automatic heartbeat keeps connection alive

## Testing

To test the logging system:
1. Run the Flask app
2. Open browser console (F12) to see connection messages
3. Submit various queries to see different log flows
4. Try invalid queries to test error logging
5. Test both GraphRAG and VectorRAG modes

## Files Modified

1. `PEERS_RAG_flask_app.py`: Added LogManager, SSE endpoint, enhanced logging
2. `templates/peers_rag_index.html`: Added log UI, JavaScript for SSE handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Export logs to file
- Filter logs by type
- Search within logs
- Detailed Neo4j query logging
- Embedding generation progress tracking
