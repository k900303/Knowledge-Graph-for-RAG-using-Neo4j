# Fixes Applied to PEERS RAG System

## Issue: "Missing some input keys: {'name', 'code'}"

### Problem
Neo4j was receiving incorrectly formatted data for Country nodes, causing the error about missing 'name' and 'code' keys.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Country Node Creation
**Before:**
```python
countries = [{"code": code, "name": code} for code in parser.get_unique_countries()]
```

**After:**
```python
countries = list(parser.get_unique_countries())
```

And updated the Cypher query to:
```cypher
UNWIND $countries AS country
MERGE (c:Country {code: country})
ON CREATE SET c.name = country
RETURN count(c) as count
```

#### 2. Fixed Company Relationships
Updated all relationship creation to use OPTIONAL MATCH with conditional FOREACH loops to handle missing or empty values.

**Example:**
```cypher
WITH company, comp
OPTIONAL MATCH (country:Country {code: comp.country_code})
FOREACH (ignore IN CASE WHEN country IS NOT NULL AND comp.country_code IS NOT NULL AND comp.country_code <> '' THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
    MERGE (company)-[:IN_COUNTRY]->(country)
)
```

This ensures:
- No errors when data is missing
- Relationships are only created when valid data exists
- All companies are processed even if some relationships fail

## Next Steps

Run the pipeline again:
```bash
python PEERS_RAG_pipeline.py
```

The fixes ensure:
- ✅ Country nodes are created properly
- ✅ Missing data doesn't cause errors
- ✅ All companies are processed
- ✅ Relationships are created only when valid
