This project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Designing the Knowledge Graph and Ingesting Data**
2. **Retrieving Data from the Knowledge Graph**
To clone this repository, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/homayounsr/Knowledge-Graph-for-RAG-using-Neo4j
```

Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```
pip install poetry
```

Then, install the project dependencies:
```
poetry install
```
Use main.py to run the application

## üöÄ Running the Web Application

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_web.txt
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python run_web_app.py
   ```

3. **Access the web app:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Test the application:**
   - Click "üîç Test Connections" to verify all systems
   - Click "‚öôÔ∏è Initialize RAG Systems" to start
   - Enter a query and click "üöÄ Submit Query"

### Using Tool Calling (NEW!)

The web app now supports **Tool Calling** mode for improved accuracy and token efficiency:

1. **Enable Tool Calling:**
   - Check the "Enable Tool Calling" checkbox in Advanced Options
   - Click "Initialize RAG Systems"
   - Tool calling uses semantic search for dynamic parameter discovery (80% token reduction)

2. **See it in action:**
   - Check "Live System Logs" to see tool execution
   - Try queries like: "Show me revenue and margin for Kajaria"

For detailed instructions, see: [START_SERVER_GUIDE.md](START_SERVER_GUIDE.md)

### Using Your Own Data
If you want to use your personal data, follow these steps:

1. Place your raw data into the Data folder.
2. Clean the data using the preprocessing script.
3. Convert the cleaned text data to JSON using the text2json script.
4. Design your custom knowledge graph by modifying the Nodes_and_Relationships.ipynb notebook in the knowledge_graph folder.
5. Use the generated JSON file as input for your knowledge graph.
6. Modify Chunking.py to chunk your file and extract properties from it
